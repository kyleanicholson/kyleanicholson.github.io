I started my first fully remote IT job in late 2018. At the time I was living in Bakersfield, California, which despite being a terrible place to live is a great place to work remotely from due to its low cost of living. I was working for a company based in San Francisco, which meant my salary was much higher than the local average, and I was able to save a lot of money and pay off my student loans very quickly. This is not an uncommon story for remote workers, and it's one of the reasons why remote work is so appealing to many people. The possibility of living where one wants and commanding a higher than average salary all without having to leave the comfort of my home office? That almost sounds too good to be true, and I would say that it is. With the transition to remote work that many companies have made since 2020, I think it's important to be honest about the downsides of remote work and to be aware of the ways in which it can be isolating and detrimental to one's mental health.

## The good things about working remotely

When you work from home in IT, it's kind of like being your own boss. No one is watching you (at least, I hope no one is) so there is a certain amount of freedom that you have to do what you want and fit your work into the rest of your life, rather than the other way around. IT work, in general, is task and project-oriented, meaning that you can easily demonstrate progress and productivity without having to be observed directly as long as your boss is not of the mindset that productivity is based on time spent in meetings or time spent banging on a keyboard. Efficiency is valuable for a remote worker, particularly one who cares about work-life balance. Without the commute, the water cooler talks, and the other distractions of the office, you can simply get a lot more done in a shorter amount of time. This means that the more efficient you are, the more freedom you have to do what you want with your time.

It's difficult to put a price on this freedom, and I have actually left jobs because I felt that this freedom was being infringed upon. I've found that having less of my time controlled by my job simply makes me happier, which in my experience is a good thing for my productivity and efficiency. So while I may not be spending as many hours at my desk as I would when working in person, I am getting the same amount (or more) done because I am happier and deliver higher quality work during the hours that I do spend at my desk.

## The bad things about working remotely

Most articles and mentions of remote work on social media focus exclusively on the sorts of things I've stated above. And while I do genuinely feel these are
