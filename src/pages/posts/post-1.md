I started learning to code in 2011. I had just graduated college with a non-CS degree, and I had no idea what I wanted
to do with my life. I had been working as a security guard to try to escape my parents' basement, but I realized two
things very quickly: 1—I would never make enough money as a security guard and 2—I hated being a security guard. So,
when I decided to quit that job in late 2011, I had no plans aside from knowing I had to find something else to do.

At the time, my best friend was working as a web developer at a small firm. He also came from a non-CS background, and
suggested that I learn to code. I was curious, but had no real idea what that meant. Despite spending a lot of my life
using computers, I had never taken any computer-related classes. I always thought programming was something that
required a lot of math, which was never my strongest subject in school. However, I was encouraged by the fact that my
friend
did not have a math background, and he had learned to code on the job without any prior knowledge.

I started by learning the fundamentals of html and css. I built a couple of simple websites that worked, although they
did not look great. I enjoyed the process of learning and had fun fixing bugs and making things run. Unfortunately, I
was starting to run out of money, so I decided to look for a job. I ultimately wound up finding a position as a
software tester at a medical technology company. The job didn't involve any coding, but with paid relocation and a
salary that allowed me to live comfortably on my own, I could not pass up the opportunity. I decided to put my coding
journey on hold and moved to a new state to start this job.

In hindsight, I view my choice to quit learning to code at this point with some regret. I know now that I could have gained a lot of ground and potentially changed my career trajectory if I had kept learning in my spare time and tried to apply some things I was learning at my job. I might have realized sooner that programming was something that I really enjoyed. Yet I can't fault myself - I was young and trying to live in the moment. It just wasn't the right time for me to pursue programming.

I'll fast-forward a few years, to 2015. I had worked the testing job for a couple of years before deciding that it was not how I wanted to spend my career. It was dull and passionless work -- I spent a most of my day copying and pasting test cases across Excel spreadsheets, repetitively pointing and
clicking in the same areas of an outdated application over and over. Although I did get to work alongside software
developers and learned a lot about their process, I never touched any code. Eventually, the monotony wore me down and I decided to quit to try something elde.

As a full time desk worker, I had observed the toll that working a 40hr/week desk job was taking on my body. I realized that
sitting still all day was the accepted norm in modern offices and thought it was a problem that I now understood well
and could do something about. I decided to enroll in a Master of Public
Health (MPH)
program in which my emphasis would be on chronic disease prevention and the promotion of physical activity in office
workers.

To my surprise, the classes that I gravitated to as an MPH student were those that involved statistics
and data analysis. I learned how to analyze scientific data by writing programs using a
statistical package called SAS. SAS was not a user-friendly platform, but I again found myself enjoying the process of
getting the computer to do what I wanted. I felt like I was finally doing something of value, and the feeling
of getting my programs to run with no errors and to produce the output I wanted was exciting and rewarding.

At this point, I decided to start learning python via FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy in parallel with my coursework. My motivation for
learning python was primarily curiosity, but also wanting to develop some additional skills that would give me more
opportunities in the future professionally and wouldn't require me to pay for a SAS software license. I had read that python was a good option for beginners who are interested in learning
learning programming fundamentals, so it seemed like the right choice for me.

I learned about
variables,
lists, loops, and conditionals. I was soon able to write simple programs that solved simple problems such as a
calculator app and a to-do list app, both of which were based on the command line. With python, I felt the same sense of
reward from getting my programs to work. I was excited to continue learning and was hopeful that I would be able to find
a way to work with code professionally in some regard.

I completed my master's degree in 2017, and initially I started looking for work in the health promotion space
as I still felt strongly about the idea of fighting against physical inactivity in the workplace. The issue was that
there were not many jobs in this field, and there were especially few jobs that actually wanted to hire someone with a
master's degree. Moreover, the pay was not all that great, and I had student loans to pay back.

With the intention of paying my loans off as fast as possible, I decided to apply for work locally in the healthcare
IT space. I ended up getting an offer from
the first job I interviewed for as an IT Analyst, which was essentially an application support position that is one step
above the help desk.

I'll be honest: I was a little disappointed at first. I had just spent two years getting a master's degree, and in some sense I felt
like I was right back where I started. However, I was
grateful to have found a stable job that paid well. I figured that I could always come back to health promotion once my loans were paid off, and I felt good about the fact that my work in IT would directly benefit healthcare providers.

As I was learning the ropes of my new job and industry, I put my learning journey on hold again. I was feeling slightly overwhelmed at the time, and didn't find much motivation to continue spending time on my computer after work. I knew that it was something that I wanted to keep doing, but it would be another couple of years before I really got serious.

I'll fast forward again to 2020. By this point I had moved to California where I had spent the past year working as an IT consultant for UC San Francisco. When COVID-19 hit, the main project I was part of ended, and all of the contract employees (including myself) were let go. I wound up accepting a full time job as an IT analyst based in Bend, OR, hoping that it would give my (soon to be) wife and me some additional financial security.

This job had a lot of elements that reminded me of my time as a software tester - particularly the repetitive nature of data entry and filling out the same forms again and again. I started to wonder if this was just going to be part of my job forever, until I happened upon the book Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart. The title really spoke to me, although I felt like it was probably going to be a computer programming book that would be too difficult for me to grasp.

I started reading the book and took Al's Coursera course. It turned out that Al is a professional software developer and his automation tool of choice was python. Since I was already fairly comfortable with the fundamentals, I found it pretty easy to understand what was going on. Because I was interested in the subject matter and how I could make my work life less painful with automation, I was invested in figuring it out.

After several months of learning, I created my first useful program. It was nothing too special, but it's hard to overstate how excited I was to have built something useful. Essentially, it was a script that could extract names from PDFs that were auto-generated by our onboarding process. When the PDFs were auto-generated they came out with filenames that were useless strings like DxAS1X2GOAM4cAS4rER. So, it was my job was to read through each one, pull out the new user's name, and retitle the file as their name so it could then be emailed to them.

Normally it took me 30-60 seconds per file when doing the renaming manually. My script took less than five seconds to run on the entire folder, which could contain as many as 20-30 pdfs at a time.
