I started learning to code in 2011. I had just graduated college with a non-CS degree, and I had no idea what I wanted
to do with my life. I had been working as a security guard to try to escape my parents' basement, but I realized two
things very quickly: 1—I would never make enough money as a security guard and 2—I hated being a security guard. So,
when I decided to quit that job in late 2011, I had no plans aside from knowing I had to find something else to do.

At the time, my best friend was working as a web developer at a small firm. He also came from a non-CS background, and
suggested that I learn to code. I was curious, but had no real idea what that meant. Despite spending a lot of my life
using computers, I had never taken any computer-related classes. I always thought programming was something that
required a lot of math, which was never my strongest subject in school. However, I was encouraged by the fact that my
friend
did not have a math background, and he had learned to code on the job without any prior knowledge.

I started by learning the fundamentals of html and css. I built a couple of simple websites that worked, although they
did not look great. I enjoyed the process of learning and had fun fixing bugs and making things run. Unfortunately, I
was starting to run out of money, so I decided I had to look for a job. I ultimately wound up finding a job as a
software tester at a medical technology company. The job didn't involve any coding, but with paid relocation and a
salary that allowed me to live comfortably on my own, I could not pass up the opportunity. I decided to put my coding
journey on hold and moved to a new state to start this job.

In hindsight, I view the choice to quit learning at this point as a mistake, because I stopped short of learning how to
write anything useful or meaningful. I also didn't make enough effort to truly figure out that programming was something
I would
actually be good at and enjoy. But I can't fault myself - I was young, fairly desperate, and I simply lacked the
maturity and discipline to take the time to do what it would take at that point in my life to learn to code.

I'll fast-forward a few years, to 2015. I had worked the QA job for a couple of years before deciding that I also hated
that job. It was mind-numbing work—copying and pasting test cases across Excel spreadsheets, repetitively pointing and
clicking in the same parts of an application again and again and again. Although I did get to work alongside software
developers, I never touched any code. Eventually, the monotony wore me down, not to mention there were limited
opportunities for growth at the company, and I was fed up with living in Wisconsin.

During my employment, I observed the toll that working a 40hr/week desk job had taken on my body. I realized that
sitting still all day was the accepted norm in modern offices and thought it was a problem that I now understood well
and could do something about. I wanted to help promote active lifestyles, so I decided to enroll in a Master of Public
Health (MPH)
program in which my emphasis would be on chronic disease prevention and the promotion of physical activity in office
workers.

To my surprise, the classes that I gravitated to during my time as an MPH student were those that involved statistics
and data analysis. I learned how to analyze scientific data by writing programs using a
statistical package called SAS. SAS was not a user-friendly platform, but I again found myself enjoying the process of
getting the computer to do what I wanted. I felt like I was finally learning real skills, and the feeling
of getting my programs to run with no errors and to produce the output I wanted was exciting and rewarding.

I decided to start learning python via FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy in parallel with my coursework. My motivation for
learning python was primarily curiosity, but also wanting to develop some additional skills that would give me more
opportunities in the future professionally and wouldn't require me to pay for a SAS license. I had read that python was
considered a 'swiss army knife' for programmers and is
considered 'the second-best option for any task.' It is also a beginner-friendly language that can be useful for
learning programming fundamentals, so it seemed like a good fit for me.

I gained a solid foundation of the python fundamentals and programming in general at this time: I learned about
variables,
lists, loops, and conditionals. I was soon able to write simple programs that solved simple problems such as a
calculator app and a to-do list app, both of which were based on the command line. With python, I felt the same sense of
reward from getting my programs to work. I was excited to continue learning and was hopeful that I would be able to find
a way to work with code professionally in some regard.

I completed my master's degree in 2017, and initially I started looking for work in the workplace health promotion space
as I still felt strongly about the idea of fighting against physical inactivity in the workplace. The issue was that
there were not many jobs in this field, and there were particularly few jobs that actually wanted to hire someone with a
master's degree. Moreover, the pay was not all that great, and I wanted to pay off my student loans as fast as possible.

With the idea of paying my loans off as fast as possible in mind, I decided to apply for work locally in the healthcare
IT space. I ended up getting an offer from
the first job I interviewed for as an IT Analyst, which was essentially an application support position that is one step
above the help desk.

I'll be honest: I was a little disappointed at first. I had just spent two years getting a master's degree, and I felt
like I was right back where I started. However, I was also
grateful to have a stable job that paid more than I would ever make in the workplace health space, and allowed me to pay
off my loans quickly, which I knew would benefit my
career in the long run. I was also excited to be working closer to the front lines of healthcare, supporting
applications that were used by doctors and nurses to care for patients.

I have been working in healthcare ever since for various healthcare organizations around the US. Recently, I have taken
up a renewed interest in learning to code; only lately it feels more serious and like I'm finally going somewhere
