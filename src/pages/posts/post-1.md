I started learning to code in 2011. I had just graduated college with a non-CS degree, and had no idea what I wanted to do professionally. I had been working as a security guard to try to escape my parents' basement, but I realized two things very quickly: 1 - I would never make enough money as a security guard and 2 - I hated being a security guard. So, when I decided to quit that job in late 2011, I had no real plans aside from knowing I had to find something else to do.

At the time, my best friend was working as a web developer at a small firm. He also came from a non-CS background, and suggested that I learn to code. I was curious, but had no real idea what that meant. Despite spending a lot of my life using computers, I had never taken any computer-related classes. I always thought programming was something that required a lot of math, which was never my strongest subject in school, but I was encouraged by the fact that my friend did not have a math background and he had learned to code on the job without any prior knowledge.

I started by learning the fundamentals of html and css. I built a couple of simple websites that worked, although they did not look good. I enjoyed the process of learning and had fun fixing bugs and making things run. Unfortunately, I was starting to run out of money, so I decided I had to look for a job. I ultimately wound up finding a job in manual quality assurance at a medical software company. The job didn't involve any coding, but with paid relocation and a salary that allowed me to live comfortably on my own, I could not pass up the opportunity. I decided to put my coding journey on hold and moved to a new state to start this job.

In hindsight, I view the choice to stop learning altogether as a mistake. I don't blame myself, because at the time I was fairly desperate and I didn't recogize the potential job opportunities learning to code would open up. I also lacked the maturity and discipline to take the time to do what it would take become a professional programmer at that point in my life. I know now that it is a lot harder than I could have imagined back then and I needed to spend a few years maturing and reflecting on what I really wanted before I could buckle down and really start to learn.

I'll fast forward a few years, to 2015. I had worked the QA job for a couple of years before deciding that I also hated that job. It was mind numbing work -- copy pasting test cases across excel spreadsheets, repetitively pointing and clicking in the same parts of an application again and again and again. Although I did get to work alongside software developers, I never touched any code. Eventually, the grind wore me down, not to mention there were limited opportunities for growth at the company and I was fed up with living in Wisconsin.

During my employment, I observed the toll that working a 40hr/week desk job had taken on my body, as well as the bodies of my friends and coworkers. I realized that sitting still all day was the accepted norm in modern offices and thought I could help combat this by promoting more active lifestyles. I decided to enroll in a Master of Public Health (MPH) program in which my emphasis would be on chronic disease prevention and the promotion of physical activity in office workers.

To my surprise, the classes that I gravitated to during my time as an MPH student were those that involved statistics and data analysis. I learned how to summarize and perform analysis on scientific data by writing programs using an statistical package called SAS. SAS was not a user-friendly platform, but I enjoyed the problem solving aspects of getting my data analysis programs to do what I wanted. I felt like I was finally learning real skills, and the feeling of getting a program to run with no errors and produce the output I wanted was a great motivator to continue learning.

I decided to start learning python via FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy in parallel with my coursework. My motivation for learning python was primarily curiosity, but also wanting to develop some additional skills that would give me more opportunities in the future professionally. Python is often described as a 'swiss army knife' for programmers and is considered 'the second best option for any task'. It is also a beginner-friendly language that can be useful for learning programming fundamentals, so it seemed like a good fit for me.

I gained a solid foundation of the fundamentals of python and programming at this time: I learned about variables, lists, loops, and conditionals. I was soon able to write very simple programs that solved simple problems such as a calculator app and a to do list app, both of which were based in the command line. With python, I felt the same sense of reward from getting my programs to work. I was excited to continue learning and was hopeful that I would be able to find a way to work with code professionally in some regard.

## Getting Derailed: Another Hiatus

I completed my master's degree in 2017 and initially I started looking for work in the workplace health promotion space as I still felt strongly about the idea of fighting against physical inactivity in the workplace. I had a couple of interviews, but zero job offers after months of searching. Again, I started running out of money so I realized I had to look for something else. I decided to apply for work locally in the healthcare IT space and I received an offer from the first job I interviewed for as an IT Analyst.
