## The Beginning

I started learning to code in 2011. I had just graduated from college with a non-CS degree, and I had no idea what I
wanted
to do with my life. I had been working as a security guard to try to escape my parents' basement, but I realized two
things very quickly: 1—I would never make enough money as a security guard and 2—I hated being a security guard. So,
when I decided to quit that job in late 2011, I had no plans aside from knowing I had to find something else to do.

At the time, my best friend was working as a web developer at a small firm. He also came from a non-CS background and
suggested that I learn to code. I was curious but had no real idea what that meant. Despite spending a lot of my life
using computers, I had never taken any computer-related classes. I always thought programming was something that
required a lot of math, which was never my strongest subject in school. However, I was encouraged by the fact that my
friend
did not have a math background, and he had learned to code on the job without any prior knowledge.

I started by learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I built a couple of simple websites that worked, although they
did not look great. I enjoyed the process of learning and had fun fixing bugs and making things work. Unfortunately, I
was starting to run out of money, so I decided to look for a job. I ultimately wound up finding a position as a
software tester at a medical technology company. The job didn't involve any coding, but with paid relocation and a
salary that allowed me to live comfortably on my own, I could not pass up the opportunity. I decided to put my coding
journey on hold and moved to a new state to start this job.

In hindsight, I view my choice to quit learning to code at this point with some regret. I know now that I could have
gained a lot of ground and potentially changed my career trajectory if I had kept learning in my spare time and tried to
apply some things I was learning at my job. I might have realized sooner that programming was something that I enjoyed.
Yet I can't fault myself—I was young, broke, and trying to live in the moment. It just wasn't the right time for me to
pursue
programming seriously.

## A Detour

I'll fast-forward a few years to 2015. I had worked the testing job for a couple of years before deciding that it was
not how I wanted to spend my career. It was dull and passionless work -- I spent most of my day copying and pasting test
cases across Excel spreadsheets, repetitively pointing and
clicking through outdated applications over and over. Although I did get to work alongside software
developers and learned about their process, I never worked directly on the software. Eventually, the monotony wore me
down, and I
decided to quit to try something else.

As a full-time desk worker, I had observed the toll that spending 40 hrs/week in a chair was taking on my body. I
realized
that
sitting still all day was the accepted norm in modern offices and thought it was a problem that I now understood well
and could do something about. I decided to enroll in a Master of Public
Health (MPH)
program in which my emphasis would be on chronic disease prevention and the promotion of physical activity in office
workers.

To my surprise, the classes that I gravitated to as an MPH student were those that involved statistics
and data analysis. I learned how to analyze scientific data by writing programs using a
statistical package called SAS. SAS was not a user-friendly platform, but I again found myself enjoying the process of
getting the computer to do what I wanted. The feeling
of getting my programs to run with no errors and to produce the output I wanted was exciting and rewarding.

At this point, I decided to start learning Python via FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy in parallel with my coursework. My
motivation for
learning python was primarily curiosity, but also wanting to develop some additional skills that would give me more
opportunities in the future professionally and wouldn't require me to pay for a SAS software license. I had read that
python was a good option for beginners who are interested in
learning programming fundamentals, so it seemed like the right choice for me.

I learned about
variables,
lists, loops, and conditionals. I was soon able to write simple programs that solved simple problems such as a
calculator app and a to-do list app, both of which were based on the command line. With Python, I felt the same sense of
reward from getting my programs to work. I was excited to continue learning, but would say I still had not found a
passion for coding and was not sure if I would find a way to
use
it in my career.

I completed my master's degree in 2017, and initially, I started looking for work in the health promotion space
as I still felt strongly about the idea of fighting against physical inactivity in the workplace. The issue was that
there were not many jobs in this field, and there were especially few jobs that wanted to hire someone with a
master's degree. Moreover, the pay was not all that great, and I had a lot of student loans to pay back.

So, intending to pay my loans off as fast as possible, I decided to apply for work locally in healthcare IT. I ended up
getting an offer from
the first job I interviewed for as an application analyst, which was essentially a technical support position that is
one step
above the help desk.

I'll be honest: I was a little disappointed. I had just spent two years getting a master's degree, and in some
sense, I felt like my career change had been a failure, and I was right back where I started. However, I was grateful to
have found a stable job that paid
well. I figured that I could always come back to health promotion once my loans were paid off, and I felt good about the
fact that my work in IT would benefit healthcare providers and patients. I also figured there might be some opportunity
to
use and improve my coding skills in the IT space.

## Finding My Way

I'll fast-forward again to 2020. By this point, I had moved to California, where I had spent the past year working as an
IT consultant for UC San Francisco. When COVID-19 hit, the main project I was part of was canceled, and all the
contract
employees, including myself, were let go. I wound up accepting a full-time analyst position based in Bend, Oregon,
hoping that it would give my (soon-to-be) wife and me some additional financial security amid the turbulence and
uncertainty of the pandemic.

The job had many elements that reminded me of my time as a software tester—particularly the repetitive tasks of data
entry, filling out forms in old programs, and moving files around from one place to another. I started to wonder if this
sort of stuff was just going to be part of my job forever. If it was, I knew I had to find a way to reduce the time
I spent on these tasks. After some Google searches, I stumbled upon the book _Automate the Boring Stuff_ by Al Sweigart.
Although I
felt like it was probably going to be a programming book that might be too advanced for me, the title spoke to me, so I
decided to give it a shot.

I ended up working through the book and Al's Coursera course with the same name. _Automate the Boring Stuff_ is
essentially a beginner's guide to python and how it can be used to create programs that perform manual tasks such as web
scraping, sending emails, and manipulating files. I found the material to be accessible, and it
helped solidify my understanding of python while also teaching me things that could have
direct carryover to my work. I found that having a practical application for my learning was a great motivator to
continue. My IT job soon
became a playground for practicing python to solve my own problems.

After several months of trial and error, I finally
wrote my first legitimately useful program. It was a script that
could read through a folder of PDFs, extract specific data, and rename each file based on that data. This was necessary
because the original PDFs were auto-generated with filenames that were useless strings like DxAS1X2GOAM4cAS4rER. Instead
of having to open each file to
find the user's name, copy, close, and rename the file, I could run my script once and rename all the files in a matter
of a few seconds.

I know it might not seem like much, but I believe this was an important milestone in my learning journey: I finally saw
firsthand what I could accomplish with programming when I had a real-world problem I could solve. Although the process I
automated was small and fairly inconsequential, my program made it much faster and less prone to mistakes. It solved a
real problem for a real person. I believe it was invaluable for me to experience that firsthand, and I view it as the
accomplishment that solidified my passion for programming and desire to write software professionally.

## Present and Future

The possibility of saving time and reducing the burden of repetitive
tasks has been a source of motivation for me ever since.
Over the past three years, I have continued to learn and
practice python and have written several more
complex programs that have saved my team time and made our routine processes more efficient.
I have also started to learn about
web development and
have built a few simple web apps using Flask and Django, and I am now diving deeper into the world of javascript.

As I have gotten deeper into python and programming in general, my passion for problem-solving through technology has
only increased, which led me to decide to work towards a degree in computer science. I have taken two university level
programming courses and am currently enrolled in my third. Eventually, my goal is to transition into working as a
software engineer full time to help build and improve products that solve real problems for real people.

Deep down, learning to code has always felt like something I was meant to do, which I think is why I kept coming back to
it over the years despite my setbacks. I know this post is rather long. However, I wanted to share my journey with
others who
may be struggling with similar setbacks
to
show that it can take a few tries, and perhaps several years of starting and stopping, before you really find your
footing. I believe losing your way is a normal part of the
process and everyone can expect to get derailed and lose sight of the end goal at some point.

With that in mind, my aim is to continue this blog to help others who might be still in the early stages of their
journey—I know that I
would have appreciated having a resource like this when I was first starting out. I also plan to continue sharing my
projects on GitHub and my portfolio site, which I hope will be useful to others as well.
